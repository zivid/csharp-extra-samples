# C# samples

This repository contains **C#** code samples for **Zivid**.

## Samples list

There are two main categories of samples: **Camera** and **Applications**. The samples in the **Camera** category focus only on how to use the camera. The samples in the **Applications** category use the output generated by the camera, such as the 3D point cloud, a 2D image or other data from the camera. These samples shows how the data from the camera can be used.

- **Camera**
  - **Basic** ([quick tutorial][QuickCaptureTutorial-url] / [complete tutorial][CompleteCaptureTutorial-url])
    - [**Capture**][Capture-url] - Acquire point clouds, with color, from the Zivid camera.
    - [**Capture2D**][Capture2D-url] - Acquire 2D images from the Zivid camera.
    - [**CaptureAssistant**][CaptureAssistant-url] - Use Capture Assistant to acquire point clouds, with color, from the Zivid camera.
    - [**CaptureFromFile**][CaptureFromFile-url] - Acquire point clouds, with color, from the virtual Zivid camera.
    - [**CaptureWithSettingsFromYML**][CaptureWithSettingsFromYML-url] - Acquire point clouds, with color, from the Zivid camera, with settings from YML file.
    - [**CaptureHDR**][CaptureHDR-url] - Acquire HDR point clouds, with color, from the Zivid camera.
    - [**CaptureHDRCompleteSettings**][CaptureHDRCompleteSettings-url] - Acquire point clouds, with color, from the Zivid camera with fully configured settings.
  - **Advanced**
    - [**CaptureHDRLoop**][CaptureHDRLoop-url] - Cover the same dynamic range in a scene with different acquisition settings to optimize for quality, speed, or to find a compromise.
  - **InfoUtilOther**
    - [**CameraUserData**][CameraUserData-url] - This example shows how to store user data on the Zivid camera.
    - [**GetCameraIntrinsics**][GetCameraIntrinsics-url] - This example shows how to get camera intrinsics from the Zivid camera.

- **Applications**
  - **Basic**
    - **Visualization**
      - [**CaptureFromFileVis3D**][CaptureFromFileVis3D-url] - This example shows how capture a Zivid point cloud from file, and visualize it.
      - [**CaptureVis3D**][CaptureVis3D-url] - This example shows how to capture a Zivid point cloud, and visualize it.
    - **FileFormats**
      - [**ReadIterateZDF**][ReadIterateZDF-url] - Read point cloud data from a ZDF file, iterate through it, and extract individual points.
      - [**ZDF2PLY**][ZDF2PLY-url] - Convert point cloud from ZDF a file to a PLY file.
  - **Advanced**
    - [**HandEyeCalibration**][HandEyeCalibration-url] - Perform Hand-Eye calibration
    - [**MultiCameraCalibration**][MultiCameraCalibration-url] - Use captures of a calibration object to generate transformation matrices to a single coordinate frame.
